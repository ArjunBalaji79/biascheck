# biascheck
An open source library for checking bias 

## Functionalities:
1) Input an LLM with ease by initialising it through an instance like langchain.llms
2) If you upload a document, it will automatically build a simple RAG pipeline (further customaisation can be added to choose which retreiver
3) You can also upload a list of polarising terms - relevant to the context you want to check in, for example it changes from country to country (helps with NER, etc..)
4) All of this will be usable from the CLI/pip library/repo
5) there will be some sample notebooks
